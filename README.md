# SingleServe

A dynamic app that serves as a platform to search and browse website-like lightweight apps.
Since React Native uses a javascript virtual machine, and js code can be downloaded without going through the app stores,
the app can simply browse to any arbitrary app implemented using react native, using an address, or suggestions using e.g.
search terms + location. This can replace web apps, or websites altogether! Imagine being in a restaurant and opening the
browser will immediately open the restaurant app, without having to download! Or getting a link to an app to control your
IoT device from the device itself via bluetooth or NFC.. Buttons and screens will become obsolete!
